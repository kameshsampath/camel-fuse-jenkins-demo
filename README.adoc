= Camel Fuse Jenkins Demo

This is a small bundle that wil be used to demonstrate the JBoss Fuse fabric deployment with Jenkins pipelines.  This
bundle has very simple Camel Jetty route that displays a greeting.


=== Assumptions

* http://www.sonatype.org/[Nexus] is setup and has repositories configured
to deploy snapshots and releases
* https://jenkins.io/index.html[jenkins] is setup and running
* The demo requires a Version Control System(VCS), this demo uses https://gogs.io/[gogs], a tiny local git server which
is will be used as VCS in the application but you can use any VCS, but make sure to update the `<scm>` section of the `pom.xml`


== Enabling PublicKey Login in JBoss Fuse

Refer to https://github.com/kameshsampath/fuse-fabric-pipelines/blob/master/README.adoc[JBoss Fuse Fabric Pipelines], which details
the steps required to enable JAAS SSH Public key login to JBoss Fuse console.

== Deploying

All the deployments are done via Jenkins, since its in CI/CD mode any changes to the application, commit
and push to the source code repository will trigger the build

== Pipeline Stages

This demo application has the following pipeline stages

* *Checkout* - this stage checks out the code from version control, and applies the Jenkins pipeline from
  link:./Jenkinsfile[Jenkinsfile]
* *Build and Test* - this performs the maven build and unit test on the source code
* *Integration Tests* - this step does any integration test if any, this demo does not have have IT tests but this stage
acts as a placeholder
* *Staging* - this deploys the build snapshot artifact to Nexus snapshots repository configured
in the `distribution management` section of `pom.xml`
* *Fuse Dev Deploy* - this step fires a set of https://github.com/kameshsampath/fuse-fabric-pipelines/blob/master/profile_update.karaf[karaf commands]
to deploy the application in JBoss Fuse

Finally there is  Workflow approval - which is used to show promotion of artifacts to Nexus releases repository
and which can be later used by production pipelines to deploy it in production

NOTE: this demo does not cover the job that performs release to production, but it could be a similar jenkins job as this
one with bit of variation and additional steps
